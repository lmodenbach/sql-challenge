# sql-challenge
 SQL data engineering and analysis project. Task was to create a database and tables to hold 6 csvs using PostgreSQL and an ERD with a data sketching tool. 8 queries were run.
The database was then imported into pandas for further analysis, including creating visualizations with matplotlib and sqlalchemy to present the conclusion that the data is irregular.
