# sql-challenge
 SQL data engineering and analysis project. Task was to create a database and tables to hold 6 csvs using PostgreSQL and an ERD with a data sketching tool.  
 8 queries were run. The database was then imported into pandas for further analysis, including creating visualizations with matplotlib and sqlalchemy to present  
 the conclusion that the data is irregular.
