# sql-challenge
 SQL data engineering and analysis project. Task was to create a database and tables  
 to hold 6 csvs while providing ERDs for those tables using PostgreSQL. 8 queries were run   
 during required analysis.  The database was then imported into pandas for further analysis,  
 including creating visualizations with matplotlib to present the conclusion that the data is  
 irregular.
